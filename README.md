Hello,

Here is my try on front end mentors Space Tourism exercise.

I struggle with the responsive, but i am learning.

I used HTML, SCSS, and a little bit javaScript.
I took some months, due to other work, to finish this project.
In a couple of weeks i will pick this back up, re-read and optimize where i can.

I keep on learning, and a good way to learn is getting feedback, and that is more than welcome. any kind of feedback.

kind regards

Steven
